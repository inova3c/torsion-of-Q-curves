This repository contains Magma code related to the computations in the paper:

Torsion of $\Q$-curves over number fields of small odd prime degree
todo: arxiv link

The version of Magma that was used is V2.28-3


The file "gl2data" is a list of all possible 2-adic Galois representations, due to Zureick and Brown. This file is needed to run some of the code. 

For each of the files, the square brackets contain the result from the paper which uses it.
